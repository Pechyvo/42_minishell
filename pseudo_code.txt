Parsing:
- cmd & their args
- < should redirect input
- > should redirect output
- << should be given a delimiter, then read the input until a line containing the delimiter is seen. However, it doesn’t have to update the history!
- >> should redirect output in append mode
- ''
- "" != $
- pipes
- Handle $? which should expand to the exit status of the most recently executed foreground pipeline.
- Handle ctrl-C, ctrl-D and ctrl-\ which should behave like in bash
- In interactive mode:
	◦ ctrl-C displays a new prompt on a new line.
	◦ ctrl-D exits the shell.
	◦ ctrl-\ does nothing.

Pseudo Code:
- parse input into tmp array
- sort and group it via special symbols
